# FITS_IMAGES_MAY_2017
My question is with the last few lines of code.  
I found the maximum for a given y value for the emission lines for y values 0-350.
Now I am trying to plot the maximum values versus the correspeonding y values
but I don't know how to print the maximum values as a list.  Also when I manually plug in some of the 
maximum values it does not appear to plot what I think I need to plot (this is the last cell).  
Any advice you have would be much appreciated.  Thank you
